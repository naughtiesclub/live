        <ul>
            <li>Added River Grouping - This plugin groups the river entries by user. It displays only the latest action of each user on river activity plus a "Show more" button for loading through AJAX more items for this user.</li>
            <li>Removed BlackNova Traders game due to server load.</li>
            <li>Removed Shadows Rising game due to server load.</li>
            <li>Reverted back to original theme due to page loading problems.</li>
    </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Made Available support, admin and webmaster internal emails</li>
            <li>Installed blacknova traders game [pre-alpha]</li>
            <li>Installed shadows rising game [pre-alpha]</li>
            <li>Implemented new theme</li>
        </ul>
    <h4 id=h4>Added new finctions:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>New Gallery - TidyPics</li>
            <li>Badges - The Badge plugin allows to award users with badges when they reach certain numbers of userpoints (not yet implemented).
Alternatively, the badges can also be assigned manually.</li>
            <li>Trusted users - This plugin is intended to be used as a dependency for other plugins that build functions specifically for trusted users.

By default there are two methods users can be considered trusted:

            <li>1. Administrator can set a user to be explicitly trusted</li>

            <li>2. Admin options allow for users to be trusted after a certain amount of membership time</li></li>
            <li>Crushes - Maintains a list of 'Crushes' users have. If crushes are mutual, it triggers a notification.</li>
            <li>Site Announcements - Inform site users about upcomming maintenance or just to tell them something important. These announcements will be shown on every page until the user has taken notice of them by clicking them away.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Pending</h2>

    <li>Block Users - This plugin gives a link on the user hover menu to block a user.

Blocked users will not have access to pages owned by the blockee, and will not be able to send messages.

Note that this will not necessarily block all content (if the content shows on a page not owned by the user), and will not block river (activity) entries.</li>
    <li>River Privacy - By default, every change you make to your profile or posting you make, can be seen by the entire network. This will hopefully fix that, making your activity visible only to your friends. (Sets non-object oriented river items to private access (eg. friend relationships))</li>
    <li>Feedback Option - Available from all pages.</li>
    <li>TidyPics Plus - Improve/Add some TidyPics functionality. Extends the TidyPics plugin to include nicer galleries and a popup image viewer.</li>
